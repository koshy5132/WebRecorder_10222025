# Workflow Snapshot - Auto URLs

## 🚀 New Features:
1. **Auto URL Loading**: Automatically reads URLs from `urls.txt` file
2. **URL Selection**: Checkbox interface to select which URLs to process
3. **Dual Input Methods**: Both auto-loaded and manual URLs supported
4. **Select All/None**: Quick selection controls

## 📁 File Structure:
```
extension-folder/
├── urls.txt                    # Auto-loaded URL list
├── manifest.json
├── background.js              # Auto URL loading logic
├── popup.html                 # New checkbox UI
├── popup.js                   # Selection management
└── [other files]
```

## 🎯 Usage:

### 1. **Setup URLs.txt**:
Edit `urls.txt` in the extension folder:
```
# Add your URLs here (one per line)
https://example.com/page1
https://example.com/page2
https://demoqa.com
# Comments are supported
```

### 2. **Using the Extension**:
- URLs auto-load from `urls.txt` on startup
- Check the URLs you want to process
- Click "Process Selected URLs"
- Or use manual input for quick additions

### 3. **Benefits**:
- ✅ **No manual copying** of URLs
- ✅ **Centralized URL management**
- ✅ **Selective processing** - choose only needed URLs
- ✅ **Team friendly** - share `urls.txt` file
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - manual input still works

## 🔧 Installation:
1. Run: `node create-workflow-snapshot-auto-urls.js`
2. Load the generated folder in `chrome://extensions/`
3. Edit `urls.txt` with your actual URLs
4. Start recording and select URLs to process

## 📝 Notes:
- URLs in `urls.txt` should be one per line
- Comments start with # and are ignored
- Invalid URLs are automatically filtered out
- Selection state is preserved during session
